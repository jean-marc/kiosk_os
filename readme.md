#Kiosk OS customization 
##Introduction
This document explains how to set-up server and clients for the rugged computer kiosk.
Configuration files are tracked with git on https://github.com/jean-marc/kiosk_os . Special hooks (note: they do not get copied when cloning a repository) need to be added to git to maintain file permission and ownership (is the file executable?...), see https://www.jottit.com/jg8h7/, the meta-data is saved in [/.gitmeta](/.gitmeta). 

Having the configuration under source control offers several advantages:

* get a log of all the modifications (similar to /etc/kiosk-notes) and the current version (actually the last commit), eg: 

```
git log

``` 

* query the version remotely (through VPN) so we can populate our management database with up-to-date information
* update OS with ```git pull``` (note we could also do a blank file synchronization with rsync as long as we include /.git)
* we could create new branches to run tests and merge in the main branch if successful 

The server hosts the OS for the clients, so we only need to document the server OS to cover the whole system.

There are three extra /etc directories:

1. [/etc_original](/etc_original): common to client and server
2. [/etc_server](/etc_server): specific to server (daemon configuration,...) 
3. [/etc_client](/etc_client): specific to NFS-mounted clients

The system relies on the above to set up two different configurations decided at boot time (through kernel parameter 'client'):

1. client: no daemons (DHCP, Apache, ...),we  have ```/etc = /etc_original```.
2. client + server: daemons are started, we have ```/etc = /etc_server + /etc_original```, where '+' means a union file system mount (/etc_server is mounted on top of /etc_original). Note: the client-only OS is still available at /client (it gets NFS-exported as defined in [/etc_server/exports](/etc_server/exports))

The union mount takes place early in the boot process through a customized initrd.img created with the initramfs tool (see [/etc_original/initramfs-tools/scripts/init-bottom/server](/etc_original/initramfs-tools/scripts/init-bottom/server) and [/etc_original/initramfs-tools/hooks/server](/etc_original/initramfs-tools/hooks/server)). This means that the OS is only usable as client-only when running in a chroot jail (unless it is possible to manually do a aufs mount in the root).

##DHCP & TFTP
Dnsmasq is used as a DHCP- and TFTP-server to send initrd.img for network boot.

* [/etc_server/dnsmasq.conf](/etc_server/dnsmasq.conf)
* [/var/ftpd/pxelinux.cfg/default](/var/ftpd/pxelinux.cfg/default)

##Web Content
The web server hosts 2 sites: http://content.unicefuganda.org and http://wikipedia.unicefuganda.org, first install apache and some dependencies:

```
apt-get install apache2 libapache2-mod-php5 php5-mysql mysql-server
```
###Content Portal
1. copy the wordpress site from a local mirror (~ 160G worth of data, will take a long time):

```
rsync -av local-mirror:/var/www/content.unicefuganda.org /var/www
```
2. copy the virtual site definition [/etc_server/apache2/sites-available/content.unicefuganda.org](/etc_server/apache2/sites-available/content.unicefuganda.org), enable the site and one module

```
wget http://raw.github.com/jean-marc/kiosk_os/master/etc_server/apache2/sites-available/content.unicefuganda.org /etc/apache2/sites-available/
a2ensite content.unicefuganda.org
a2enmod rewrite
```
3. create the database 'unicef' and a user 'unicef_content' to access it, in mysql client:

```
create database unicef;
grant all privileges on unicef.* to 'unicef_content'@'localhost' identified by 'password';
```
where 'password' must match the credentials in /var/www/content.unicefuganda.org/wp-config.php, the site should be up and running.

###Wikipedia
The offline wikipedia uses the [kiwix](http://kiwix.org/wiki/Main_Page) server, relevant files are:

1. copy the daemon kiwix-serve (and kiwix-index if needed) from local mirror
2. copy the upstart job [/etc_server/init/kiwix-serve.conf](/etc_server/init/kiwix-serve.conf)
	```
	wget http://raw.github.com/jean-marc/kiosk_os/master/etc_server/init /etc_server/init/
	```
3. copy the virtual site definition [/etc_server/apache2/sites-available/wikipedia.unicefuganda.org](/etc_server/apache2/sites-available/wikipedia.unicefuganda.org), a proxy for the kiwix server, listening on port 1080

```
wget http://raw.github.com/jean-marc/kiosk_os/master/etc_server/apache2/sites-available/wikipedia.unicefuganda.org /etc/apache2/sites-available/
a2ensite wikipedia.unicefuganda.org
a2enmod proxy-http
```
4. get the zim archive from local mirror (also available at http://kiwix.org/wiki/Wikipedia_in_all_languages) and the index (it can also be generated with kiwix-index)

```
rsync -av local-mirror:/var/lib/kiwix /var/lib
```

##NFS
The server exports a large subset of its file system on the local network (192.168.4.0/24) through NFS.
[/etc_server/exports](/etc_server/exports)
Note that booting clients is pretty taxing on the NFS server (for some reason booting an NL2 client:~30s is faster than NL3:~120s, there might be some problem on the client side) and can cause failures if booting more than one client at a time, the script [/etc_server/init.d/manage_client](/etc_server/init.d/manage_client) has been modified to stagger the boots and minimize the load (it might be good to delete /var/lib/misc/dsmasq.leases on a new set).

##Proxy/Firewall
[/etc_server/network/interfaces](/etc_server/network/interfaces)

##Internet Access
Internet is mainly accessed with GPRS modems with the PPP protocol. Relevant files are:

* [/etc_server/chatscripts/orange](/etc_server/chatscripts/orange)
* [/etc_server/ppp/peers/orange](/etc_server/ppp/peers/orange)
* [/etc_server/network/interfaces](/etc_server/network/interfaces)
* [/etc_server/cron.d/modem_reconnect](/etc_server/ncron.d/modem_reconnect) a cron job that will attempt a reconnection if interface ppp0 is down.

The interface is brought up by /sbin/ifup, unfortunately it causes a disconnection as soon as the link is established (see bug https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ppp/+bug/776193

##HTTP filter
We use a combination of caching-proxy server Squid (www.squid-cache.org) and filter SquidGuard (www.squidguard.org) and some iptable rules to redirect HTTP traffic to Squid. 
SquidGuard kicks in right before the page is about to be fetched, URL and IP address are checked against information in /var/lib/squidguard/db and if deemed inappropriate URL is rewritten to http://192.168.4.1/blocked. The database is built from regularly updated blacklist available on-line see http://www.squidguard.org/blacklists.html.

* [/etc_server/squid3/squid.conf](/etc_server/squid3/squid.conf) note the line ```acl lan src all``` to allow the server to access squid because of no prior knowledge of the IP address given through DHCP by the Internet provider. 
* [/etc_server/squid/squidGuard.conf](/etc_server/squid/squidGuard.conf), 
* /usr/local/squid/var/cache/squid the squid cache, note that content.unicefuganda.org and wikipedia.unicefuganda.org are excluded from the cache because thoses sites are hosted locally (it should always cause a 'TCP_MISS' in /var/log/squid3/access.log)
* [/etc_server/network/interfaces](/etc_server/network/interfaces), note the use of '--uid-owner' to filter the HTTP traffic leaving the server
* [/var/www/blocked](/var/www/blocked) the page returned when a site is blocked.

Note that HTTPS traffic is not filtered.

##Webalizer
The report (eg. http://monitor.unicefuganda.org/webalizer/) is updated everyday based on the Squid log file (becauses it filters all HTTP requests), it is available locally at http://server/management/webalizer and on the Internet at http://monitor.unicefuganda.org/monitor/webalizer/. 

* [/etc_server/webalizer/webalizer.conf](/etc_server/webalizer/webalizer.conf)

##VPN
As soon as a connection to the Internet is available, the kiosk connects to a VPN server (http://monitor.unicefuganda.org) and joins a virtual network using a unique certificate. The central server can easily connect to any on-line kiosk and run a SSH session (provided public key has been exchanged), kiosks can also bypass the server and talk to each other. 

* /etc_server/openvpn/ca.crt
* [/etc_server/openvpn/client.conf](/etc_server/openvpn/client.conf)
* /etc_server/openvpn/kiosk-generic.crt
* /etc_server/openvpn/kiosk-generic.key

The same certificate can be used on all kiosks, the server will identify individual machines based on their MAC address (/sys/class/net/eth0/address), that information already exists in our management database [http://monitor.unicefuganda.org/sparql?query=describe &lt;96344&gt;](http://monitor.unicefuganda.org/sparql?query=describe%20%3C96344%3E ):
```xml
<mon:Server rdf:ID="96344">
	<mon:time_stamp_v>2013-03-08T21:31:58</mon:time_stamp_v>
	<mon:partOf rdf:resource="#uniport-0"/>
	<mon:model rdf:resource="#D2"/>
	<mon:_mac_>3018ac5fed</mon:_mac_>
</mon:Server>
```
The above snippet indicates that the server with MAC address 3018ac5fed is part of 'uniport-0'. The advantage of that scheme is that all kiosks run exactly the same OS (same hostname, VPN certificats,...) and makes deployment and update easier.
The hostname could also be set automatically by running a database query once at installation, it would require network access to the database or have some cache installed locally, note that it would still use the same VPN certificate but would make identification simpler(```ssh 10.8.0.123 hostname```).


##Client control
Once the server is on, it can start all the clients on the local interface through wake-on-LAN, it will also shut them down before going down.
Wake-on-LAN is a low-level protocol, a machine will turn on if it receives a magic packet on an interface (it must be enable in the BIOS and there are other conditions).
The server uses information stored by the DHCP server in /var/lib/misc/dnsmasq.leases to send magic packets to all the machines that have ever been given a lease (sending UDP packets takes almost no time so it is not such a waste), that means that a new client will have to be started manually.
Shutting down a client is simpler, a simple SSH session is run to invoke poweroff. (note: some NL3 some time reboot instead of shutting down on receiving a 'poweroff' command, to be investigated).

The relevant files are:

* /var/lib/misc/dnsmasq.leases that file is created by dnsmasq
* [/etc_server/init.d/manage_client](/etc_server/init.d/manage_client) reads from the DHCP lease list to turn on clients (or when invoked as ```/etc/init.d/manage_client start```), it reads from the ARP list to shut them down (or when invoked as ```/etc/init.d/manage_client stop```). That script gets installed by running ```update-rc.d manage_client defaults``` (alternatively we could use an upstart job).


##Power management

The main task is to log information from the charge controller and trigger a shutdown when the voltage is nearing a set threshold.
We currently support two models: Morningstar TS-45 and Phocos C-40.
A few files are needed to run the power management task:

* [/etc_server/udev/rules.d/99-persistent-usb_serial_2.rules](/etc_server/udev/rules.d/99-persistent-usb_serial_2.rules)
	it will create a symbolic link to the USB device eg:

	```
	$ ls -l /dev/ts_45 
	lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 7 2013-03-08 16:51 /dev/ts_45 -> ttyUSB0
	```
* [/usr/local/bin/ts_45.sh](/usr/local/bin/ts_45.sh) invokes the program defined in $CHARGE_CONTROLLER and filter it with the awk script and writes to the log file. It will trigger a shutdown if the voltage is below $LOW_VOLTAGE_DISCONNECT_12 or $LOW_VOLTAGE_DISCONNECT_24 (the actual variable is picked depending on current voltage)
* [/usr/local/bin/ts_45.awk](/usr/local/bin/ts_45.awk) awk script to format output for logging (time stamp and comma separated values).
* /var/log/ts_45.log
* [/etc_server/profile.d/kiosk_parameters.sh](/etc_server/profile.d/kiosk_parameters.sh)
	this where global environment variables are defined including $CHARGE_CONTROLLER
* crontab the above script is run every 10 minutes: (the interval could be made longer) */10 * * * * /usr/local/bin/ts_45.sh; 
* [/usr/local/bin/udp_ping.sh](/usr/local/bin/udp_ping.sh) sends UDP messages to the monitoring server on expired MTN modems (see http://mbuya.unicefuganda.org/?p=642).
Note: the script is also invoked by the remote monitoring task (see remote monitoring) and care must be taken they do not run a the same time.
Note: names should be changed from 'ts_45' to something more generic
User 'unicef_admin' should be part of group 'dialout' to be allowed to open the device.

###TS_45
The TS 45 is a solar charger, it means that it does not keep track of the current going through the load, just the voltage. 
need to install libmodbus, there does not seem to be .deb package so you have to build it, get the archive from http://libmodbus.org/download/, unpack, run 

```
	./configure 
	make
	sudo make install
	sudo ldconfig
```
build the client (https://github.com/jean-marc/ts_mppt)

###Phocos
The charge controller uses a TTL interface and requires a TTL-to-serial or TTL-to-USB adapter (eg. [here](http://compare.ebay.com/like/251117477526?var=lv&ltyp=AllFixedPriceItemTypes&var=sbar&_lwgsi=y&cbt=y)). The client is a python script (https://github.com/jean-marc/ts_mppt/blob/master/phocos.py)

##Traffic accounting

Part of the monitoring task is to measure how much data is being used for Internet access, a few files are necessary:

* [/etc_server/init/traffic_accounting.conf](/etc_server/init/traffic_accounting.conf)
	set up a few rules to capture traffic going out, management traffic (to and from 196.0.26.0/24) is separated from the rest. An environment variable $NET defines the interface used to access the Internet (eg. ppp0 for USB modem, eth0 for Ethernet) (see http://mbuya.unicefuganda.org/?p=703)
* [/usr/local/bin/safe_iptables.sh](/usr/local/bin/safe_iptables.sh) script to read the counter
* [/etc_server/sudoers.d/safe_iptables](/etc_server/sudoers.d/safe_iptables) allows to run the above script without entering password (for remote monitoring), it will be invoked as ```sudo safe_iptables.sh```
Counters get reset when machine is turned off.

##Client file system

All the clients see the same file system with some slight variations when network-mounted:

* [/etc_original/fstab](/etc_original/fstab)
* [/etc_client/fstab](/etc_client/fstab)

A [tmpfs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tmpfs) file system is union-mounted on top of the /home/user directory, this makes possible to set up default configurations eg. home pages for browser while allowing the user to make temporary modifications, all changes will be lost once the machine reboots. The reason for that design decision is to guarantee system stability, the downside is the inability to save any file except on external storage (USB stick, cellphone) and increased RAM used (the clients should use swap space unless there is no hard-drive).
Based on user s feedback we will create new regular accounts without the above limitations (that creates other problems if the same account is used on different machines at the same time). 
Note that unicef_admin is a regular account but is reserved for administration.

##Thin Clients

There is a provision to have older machines connect as client, they might not have enough CPU power or RAM to run the OS and applications, the solution is to place the burden on the server, the client just run a graphical client (over ssh) but all the applications are run on the server see www.ltsp.org for more information on thin clients.

## Git specifics

The repository is hosted on github but also on our local server, to get the latest run (for a machine on the local network)

```
sudo git pull ssh://root@master.local/srv/server_less_os
```
This is convenient for incremental changes, rsync will still be necessary in case of new binary files (executables, media, database,...)
